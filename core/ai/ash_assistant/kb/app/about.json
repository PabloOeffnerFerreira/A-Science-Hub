  "title": "About ASH (A Science Hub)",
  "summary": "ASH is a personal science suite created by Pablo Oeffner Ferreira. It organizes more than 100 interactive tools into categories and labs, serving both as a calculator and as a learning platform.",
  "updated": "2025-08-24",
  "body": {
    "main_goal": "Provide a unified, offline-accessible hub for exploring, calculating, and visualizing concepts in science. It is designed not just as a toolkit, but as a personal environment for learning through interaction and visualization.",
    "vision": [
      "Turn formulas into interactive tools to make abstract concepts tangible.",
      "Enrich every tool with plots, simulations, and 3D visualizations for better understanding.",
      "Use ASH as both a reference and an active learning assistant."
    ],
    "design_principles": [
      "Keep interfaces minimal and fast for input â†’ result workflows.",
      "Tools and labs are modular: categories in /tools map directly to tool dropdowns.",
      "Knowledge is stored locally, ensuring independence from external servers."
    ],
    "scope": {
      "categories": "ASH spans across astronomy, biology, chemistry, electricity, geology, math, mechanics, microbiology, optics, and waves.",
      "labs": "Collections of related tools such as the Element Lab, Molecule Library, Mechanics Lab, DNA Lab, Electricity & Magnetism Lab, Geo Lab."
    },
    "future": [
      "Expand tool explanations: not just results, but intuition, formula derivations, and unit checks.",
      "Add educational features like guided workflows and typical error warnings.",
      "Deeply integrate the ASH assistant with this knowledge base for navigation and help."
